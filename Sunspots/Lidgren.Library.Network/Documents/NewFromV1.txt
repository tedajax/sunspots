
New features over version 1 of Lidgren.Library.Network

* Ordered reliable channels
* Clock synchronization, packet timestamping
* Ability to simulate lag, loss and duplicated packets
* Network settings (resend times etc) per connection, automatic optimization using roundtrip time
* Encryption and authentication
* Nicer log output in html

Mostly the same API with a few minor changes:
* no need to call 'NetBase.NewMessage()', just create a message using 'new NetMessage()'
* delivery method is specified in SendMessage() instead of at message creation
* sequence channel and delivery method is now explicitly linked, fixes a difficult "bug" in last version where mixing different delivery methods in the same channel would give undefined results
